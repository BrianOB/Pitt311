# Pittsburgh 311 Calls

This is an analysis of Pittsburgh 311 service call data downloaded from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center on Aug. 23, 2018.
https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/311-data

The data gets updated regularly but I don't see a way yet to update it here automatically. I hope to find a way so any constructive suggestions would be welcome. When I download it, the file name is a long string of letters and numbers. I rename it to pitt311data.csv so I don't have to change the code every time the city updates the data.

BasicAnalysis.Rmd and DaytimePop.Rmd are working files I'm using to analyze data for the report, which is Pittsburgh311Calls.Rmd.
