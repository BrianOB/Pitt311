# Project Title

This is an analysis of Pittsburgh 311 service call data downloaded from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center on Aug. 23, 2018.

The data gets updated regularly but I don't see a way yet to update it here automatically. I hope to find a way so any constructive suggestions would be welcome.
